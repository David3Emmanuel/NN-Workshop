# Neural Networks Practical Workshop

## Workshop Overview

This 2-hour practical workshop introduces participants to neural networks through hands-on exercises. Participants will build, train, and evaluate neural network models using Python and PyTorch. The workshop includes a detailed walkthrough of creating neural networks from scratch to understand the fundamental concepts, followed by implementation using PyTorch.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts
- Installed Python environment with:
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Scikit Learn

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Start with `01_nn_introduction_and_setup.ipynb` and follow through the sequence of notebooks

## Workshop Content

The workshop is organized as a series of notebooks:

1. `01_nn_introduction_and_setup.ipynb` - Neural network fundamentals and environment setup
2. `02_nn_from_scratch.ipynb` - Building neural networks from scratch with NumPy
3. `03_mnist_dataset.ipynb` - Loading and exploring the MNIST dataset
4. `04_pytorch_implementation.ipynb` - Implementing neural networks with PyTorch
5. `05_comparison.ipynb` - Comparing custom and PyTorch implementations
