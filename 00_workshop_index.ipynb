    "# Neural Networks Workshop - Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Neural Networks Workshop! This series of notebooks will guide you through understanding, implementing, and experimenting with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop has been divided into five focused notebooks that build on each other sequentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Introduction and Setup**](01_nn_introduction_and_setup.ipynb) - Learn the fundamentals of neural networks and set up your environment\n",
    "2. [**Neural Networks from Scratch**](02_nn_from_scratch.ipynb) - Build a neural network using only NumPy to understand core concepts\n",
    "3. [**MNIST Dataset Exploration**](03_mnist_dataset.ipynb) - Load and analyze the MNIST handwritten digits dataset\n",
    "4. [**PyTorch Implementation**](04_pytorch_implementation.ipynb) - Implement neural networks efficiently with PyTorch\n",
    "5. [**Implementation Comparison**](05_comparison.ipynb) - Compare custom and PyTorch implementations for insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the fundamental concepts behind neural networks\n",
    "- Be able to implement a basic neural network from scratch\n",
    "- Know how to use PyTorch to build and train neural networks\n",
    "- Be able to evaluate and compare different neural network implementations\n",
    "- Have practical experience with the MNIST dataset\n",
    "\n",
